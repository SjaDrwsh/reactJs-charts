How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

- In details: (one day in this context means -> 4-5 hours after work)
  -- One day to brain storm ideas and have an overview of given APIs
  -- One day to setup project
  -- Two days for implementing the solution
  -- one day to add unit tests

- I would have change a bit of structure
- I would have given more thoughts into the separation of components and making them more dynamic
- I would have added more unit tests

What alternative approaches/solutions to the user story did you consider when engineering your solution? What benefits/downsides would they have had compared to the selected solution?

- I considered not just the manager but also my self as we can all relate and keep up to date with current corona virus so i added more information to the solution

What additional features/improvements do you think could help the customer gain more value from your application?

- we can still add a lot of information regarding germany overview, tests and vaccination per state, vaccination types ..

Where do you see issues in your code that might cause issues in the future? How would you monitor the performance of your app?

- change the way interfaces are defined as they are a bit complicated due to the returned APIs callback data
- We might wanna think of using for example webpack 5 due to the new feature added in that version
- create more dynamic components to be reused
- I would have added route module to switch between tabs using routes to be able to save state for data, search and other.

How would you improve the API that you just used or its documentation?

- the apis were also a bit messy and had to map data in services before sending them to component, if I created backend APIs would have returned more clear interfaces.
- also the documentation was not clear regarding what each attribute presents for example

What did you think about this test? How interesting was it for you? How would you recommend us to improve the test?

- the idea was very relatable and as a user It was relatable to our daily life at the moment. Nothing really to improve
